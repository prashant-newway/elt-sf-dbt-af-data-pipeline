ELT workflow where loading data in snowflake -> transform in dbt within snowflake because it is supercheap . 
Airflow as the management tool for all the dbt workflow providing with UI to monitor these workflows . Instead of using bash operator trigger 
dbt commands which involved two different dags.
using cosmos for airflow to easily get insights in the ongoing sub actions in the dbt.gives full visibility in the dbt workflow. 
only one dag to be created .cosmos + airflow - cosmos read dbt  and will provide visualization layer of dbt workflow within airflow .
gives context in the rest of the data pipeline and not work in isolation.
